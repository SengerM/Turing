<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Airbnb is a company focused on lodging worldwide. In this report some results from its operations in London, UK, are presented. The raw data can be found in <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">this link</a>. This data contains information on the different listings in London, as well as all the guests reviews from 2010 up to the present.</p>

</presentation_display_block>
<presentation_display_block>

<h1>Objective</h1>

<p>I focused the analysis in:
	<ul>
		<li>Finding which neighborhoods are more profitable.</li>
		<li>See if there is some tendency for this to change in time.</li>
		<li>Can the business still expand?</li>
	</ul>
</p>

</presentation_display_block>
<presentation_display_block>

<h1>Results</h1>

<ul class="spaced">
	<li>Ideal information: Occupancy rate of each listing.</li>
	<li>It is not available. &#128543;</li>
	<li>We do have the <em>number of reviews per month</em> for each listing.</li>
	<li>Can we exploit the (reasonable) correlation between them? This can be dangerous because:
	<ul>
		<li>Listings with $\approx 30 \frac{\text{reviews}}{\text{month}}$ obviously have high occupancy rate. &#9989; (Relation almost deterministic.)</li>
		<li>Smaller values have big uncertainties! Is it small because it is not occupied or because it is occupied for long periods?</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

</presentation_display_block>
<presentation_display_block>

<p>Furthermore, most listings have $ \lesssim 4 \frac{\text{reviews}}{\text{month}}$:</p>

<image src="media/price_vs_reviews_per_month.png" style="max-width: 555px; width: 100%;"></image>

<p>Because of this I avoided estimating any kind of revenue per listing.</p>

</presentation_display_block>
<presentation_display_block>

<p>We can sort the neighborhoods by reviews per month and plot them to get a visual idea of the orders of magnitude:</p>

<iframe src="media/reviews_per_month.html" class="plotly"></iframe>

<p>Top neighborhood is <em>Westminster</em>, almost twice as next ones.</p>

</presentation_display_block>
<presentation_display_block>

<p>How efficient is each neighborhood? Normalize the reviews per month by the number of listings:</p>

<iframe src="media/neighbourhoods.html" class="plotly"></iframe>

<ul class="spaced">
	<li>Westminster among the most efficients, also among highest rates.</li>
	<li>Hillingdon is the most efficient under this definition.</li>
</ul>

</presentation_display_block>
<presentation_display_block>

<p>Evolution in time? Casually Hillingdon seems to be growing at a higher rate than the others:</p>

<iframe src="media/reviews_vs_year.html" class="plotly"></iframe>

<ul class="spaced">
	<li>The number of reviews per year in all the neighborhoods seems to keep growing "almost" exponentially each year.</li>
	<li>The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is visible: 2020 was at the level of 2016.</li>
</ul>

</presentation_display_block>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<ul class="spaced">
	<li>An overview of the activity of Airbnb in London was presented.</li>
	<li>The top neighborhoods in terms of number of reviews per month were identified.</li>
	<li>A simple criterion for efficiency of each neighborhood was defined.</li>
	<li>Despite all the neighborhoods seem to grow at a similar rate, Hillingdon shows a higher rate which could be somehow exploited (marketing?).</li>
	<li>The number of reviews per year was growing "almost exponentially" before the pandemic, there is still room to expand the business.</li>
</ul>
